# 1. Check if python3 is installed.
# 2. Create a virtual environment named 'venv'.
# 3. Install the required Python packages into the venv.
# 4. Provide clear instructions for the final steps.

# To run:
# 1. Save this script as 'setup.sh' in your project root.
# 2. Make it executable: chmod +x setup.sh
# 3. Run it: ./setup.sh
